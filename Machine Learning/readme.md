To begin understanding Machine Learning algorithms, I started using the concepts of various algorithms on the real world data. I worked on the fMRI timeseries data of various brain regions and clustered the regions based on the type of activity they exhibited.
There are many errors, mainly in the first few files, However I kept on working on those mistakes and applied various clustering algorithms to check how each algorithm worked and how accurtely they clustered the data.
